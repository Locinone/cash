	Cash, the Caml Shell

*** What is Cash ***
Cash is a Unix shell (for scripting only) that is embedded within Objective
Caml.  It's a Caml reimplementation of (an as large as possible subset of) Scsh,
the Scheme Shell by Olin Shivers.  See the manual doc/doc.ps for complete
documentation.

*** What you need ***
- OCaml 3.04 installed
- Sources of the installed OCaml compiler
- PCRE installed (preferably in ocaml_install_dir/lib/ocaml/contrib, but you
  should be able to export PCRELIBDIR=/some/other/path before configure)
- make

*** How to compile ***
- ln -s directory_with_the_compiled_ocaml_sources ocaml
- ./configure
- make 
- make install
	will install cash/cashr in ocaml_install_dir/bin 
	and libs in ocaml_install_dir/lib/ocaml/contrib
- make latex / ps / html
        will make the manual doc/doc.dvi / doc/doc.ps / doc/*.html.  You need an
        up-to-date ocamldoc (CVS version).

Good luck,
